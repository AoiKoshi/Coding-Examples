Welcome to my git repository for my example projects!

These are systems and/or mechanics I've created, most of the time for other projects,
that have been stripped down to their core elements to serve as a proof of concept
and implementation.

### [Unity demos](https://github.com/AoiKoshi/Coding-Examples/wiki/Unity-demos)
* Advanced Third Person Controller
* RPG systems
* Multiplayer (Unity Netcode)

### [Pure C++ programs](https://github.com/AoiKoshi/Coding-Examples/wiki/Pure-C---Programs)
* Simple calculator
* String manipulator
* TripleX text-based game

More will be added over time. You can check out these systems being implemented in my work
on my website: www.kruzeraptor.co.uk
