Welcome to my git repository for my example projects!

These are systems and/or mechanics I've created, most of the time for other projects,
that have been stripped down to their core elements to serve as a proof of concept
and implementation.

## [Unity demos](www.github.com/AoiKoshi/Coding-Examples/wiki)
-Advanced Third Person Controller
-RPG systems
-Multiplayer (Unity Netcode)

More will be added over time. You can check out these systems being implemented in my work
on my website: www.kruzeraptor.co.uk
